Clean up the code to follow the physics book and reference it
Serway Vuille College Physics

Store variables in an array, because
 - need to look up symbols, eg if equation looks for 'a' ask array where 'a' is
 - need to do SI unit conversion, eg m/s <> km/h
 - need to apply correct calculations if type is vector/scalar + determine direction

예를드러
name      = gravity
value     = 9.81
symbol    = g, a
SI unit   = m/s^2
type      = vector
direction = -y

name      = initial velocity
value     = .
symbol    = vi
SI unit   = m/s
type      = vector
direction = .

name      = speed
value     = .
symbol    = r
SI unit   = m/s, km/h
type      = scalar
direction = N/A

eg array would be like this
['gravity', 9.81, g|a, m/s^2, 'vector', '-y']
['velocity initial', , vi, m/s, 'vector', ]
['speed', , r, m/s|km/hr, 'scalar', 0]


I propose to restructure the code into types
Eg kinematics, dynamics, work&energy&power&elasticity etc
From the menu driven, we can select from either
webassign, past year exam questions, of types.

Eg
1. webassign
    -> chose a week
        -> chose a question

        eg week 1 question 4
        a car falls at rate of x to y direction (must have specific numbers, but ask to change)
        you can select input variables

        after calculations are complete, return to previous menu

2. type
    -> chose a type
        -> kinematic
              rocket up ()
              a rocket is launched from y0 at etc
              select input variables

3. past year exams
