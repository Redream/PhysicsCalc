# PhysicsCalc
COSC121 calculator for PHYS111/101 equations, written in Python 3

The aim of this project is to be a simple shell driven app which solves mathematical equations related to PHYS111/101.
It should be reasonably simple and not deviate too much from the pace of the course, as the idea is to learn coding,
as well as try to learn physics calculations and formulas.

It will also display the formulas that it is doing, so you can follow, why something does something.
